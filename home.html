    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
    <p>
        The magazine exposes common issues facing everyone and attempts to deal with the subjects through
        exposure to feelings and efforts from artistic communities, ranging from dance, digital media, painting,
        illustration, graphic design and music.
        The art in the magazine is beautiful, the stories intriguing, and sometimes humorous and outspoken.
        The artists are not located in any particular region but they all share a common thread - the need to voice
        what is in their souls and to share that with their fellow man.
