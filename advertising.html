    <h3>Demographics</h3>
    <p>
        The magazine exposes common issues facing everyone and attempts to deal with the subjects through
        exposure to feelings and efforts from artistic communities, ranging from dance, digital media, painting,
        illustration, graphic design and music.
        The art in the magazine is beautiful, the stories intriguing, and sometimes humorous and outspoken.
        The artists are not located in any particular region but they all share a common thread - the need to voice
        what is in their souls and to share that with their fellow man.

        The readers of Vox Animae are interested in learning about average people going about their lives in above-average ways;
        people who are making a difference in their own world, and defining a meaningful life for themselves and the people
        they care about.  This magazine knows no socio-economic bounds; it is classless. It is a magazine dedicated
        to those on their own road of self of discovery.

        Interested in exploring the world around them, our readers are innately curious.  They want to know who is
        doing what, and where are they doing it.

        And they need stuff, too. Clothing that helps them express themselves.  Products that help them articulate
        their dreams and desires more effectively.  Personal services to help them understand where they are going and
        to help them get there.
